This repository will hold your portfolio projects for this semester. You should customise this README.md file to document your own work - add your name and details and describe what you've done. This will be displayed on your Github page.

## Portfolio projects

## 1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling
In this portfolio, my main objective is data analysis which includes: 
- Combine Cheetah and Strava dataframes together using "join" and "merge" method from panda
- Remove variables that have a specific value
- Use histograms to analyse distribution of some variables 
- Evaluate the relationship between a given set of variables using heatmap 
- Explore the difference between different types of workout 
- Combine with weather data and check if temperature affects the rider's performance

## 2. Producing data visualization for Energy Usage 
The main purpose of this portfolio is to reproduce the tasks for energy usage data. My method includes: 
- Producing histogram and boxplot to check for distribution
- Making graphs of energy usage by the duration length of the data and by weeks
- Making pairs plot to illustrate the relationship between the energy consumption of appliances
- Produce heatmaps 
- Making regression model and graph using RFE algorithms 

## 3. Analysis and build a predictive model for the genre of a book based on a summary
In the third portfolio, my task is to build two predictive model and evaluate them side by side. Here are the methods that were implemented: 
- Analysis the text for feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer method from sklearn
- Using Hierarchical Clustering method for data visualization, in this case based on author and title column 
- Using and training KNN and Naive Bayes models for prediction 
- Evaluates both of them base on accuracy
